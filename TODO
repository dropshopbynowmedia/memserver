build the CI,
wire @ember/string from ember-source through typescript || use inflected
write the build process
through embroider create a local ember-packages and wire them to memserver with right module names

maybe remove require.caches for tests

JS needs pipeline operator(|>) and cheap Rust bindings(JS<->Rust) and better/flawless ava API(test.serial, test etc)
